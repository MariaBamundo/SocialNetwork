So, this ain't the end, I saw you again, today
I had to turn my heart away
Smiled like the sun, kisses for everyone
And tales, it never fails
You lying so low in the weeds
I bet you gonna ambush me
You'd have me down, down, down on my knees
Now wouldn't you, barracuda? oh
Back over time we were all trying for free
You met the porpoise and me
No right, no wrong you're selling a song, a name
Whisper game
If the real thing don't do the trick
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick
Oooo, barracuda, oh yeah
"Sell me, sell you" the porpoise said
Dive down deep to save my head
